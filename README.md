# defense mania graphics

> A crossplatform tower defense game built with processing.
> This repository includes all original project files for all the graphics used in the game.

## prerequisites

You need **Adobe Photoshop** or something else that can read/write PSD files and **Cinema 4D Version 11.5 or higher** to edit the project files.

## sizes and sets

### charsets

There are 2 different charsets: enemies and towers. We used a tile-size of 64x64 pixels for the actual game graphics.

### tilesets

We used a tile-size of 32x32 pixels for the actual game graphics.

### tile size

You can use the tile size you want, the Map Editor can handle every tile size that is dividable by 2. Keep in mind that you can only use **one tileset** for **one map** and you can only use **one tile size** for **all enemies** on one map.

## contribute

If you created new graphics, fork this repo and create a pull-request. So others can use your graphics for new maps.

Spread the open source tower defense love. <3
